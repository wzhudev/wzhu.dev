Aiming to build productivity applications (and libraries) that both users
and developers will love, I focused on collaboration algorithms, rendering
techniques, editors, distributed systems and software architecture. 

Here's a summary of my work so far.

## Professional

### Univer

[Univer](https://univer.ai) ðŸŒŒ is a framework for 
building office suites, including documents, spreadsheets and slides. It's highly
extensible and can be embedded into other applications. Univer 
now has been adopted by several companies.

I joined Univer in its very early stage as Tech Lead and Architect.
I designed its architecture, coded lots of core parts of it, review tech designs and
pull requests, talk to our global customers, supervise the engineering team and
support other engineers.

We not have over 10 customer globally, including fortune 500 companies.

**Technical Contributions**

**Architecture**

Univer uses a plugin-based architecture and dependency injection to create a 
highly extensible architectural foundation. In Univer, functionalities are registered 
into the application in the form of plugins, which means that users can choose 
the plugins they register according to their actual needs, and even develop 
their own plugins. Some pro features are implemented as close source plugins 
to serve the company's business model.

Moreover, it maximizes the isomorphism of various systems within Univer.
By loading different plugins and injecting different dependencies, Univer can
run on desktop and mobile browsers, as well as in web workers or Node.js as
a computation engine or a collaborative engine.

Read more about its architecture in the [architectural guide](https://univer.ai/guides/sheet/architecture/univer).

**Collaboration editing**

Collaborative editing is crucial to productivity applications. This involves
multiple people editing the same document simultaneously. I engineered Univer's
collaborative engine from the ground up. This engine leverages a state
machine model and operational transformation (OT). It delivers this capability
across various document types and supports offline editing. The team has
enhanced it with advanced transformation functions, a comprehensive file
history feature, and robust performance improvements.

You can read more about the system here: [The OT algorithm and Univer's Collaborative Editing Design](https://univer.ai/blog/post/ot).

**RPC & remote computing**

For Univer instances deployed in different threads to communicate seamlessly,
I designed and implemented the RPC packages. Univer now excels at running
its frontend in the browser, while handling calculations in Web Worker,
or even in a Node.js process on the Univer server. This significantly boosts
performance and enhances experience. You can read more about this on
our [official guide](https://univer.ai/guides/sheet/architecture/web-worker).

**Data Analysis Agents**

Univer's data analysis agents are designed to provide users with
intelligent data analysis capabilities. These agents can analyze data
in spreadsheets and generate insights, such as identifying trends,
summarizing data, and generating visualizations. I prototyped
the multi agent system with Langgraph.

**Dark Mode**

I contributed to the development of dark mode in Univer, mainly on the Canvas-based rendering engine. I developed a color transformation algorithm that can automatically adjust the colors of the document to match the dark mode theme, to ensure that the document is readable and visually appealing in dark mode.

**Management Contributions**

**Team building**

I hired the founding front-end engineers and am responsible for technical interviews.
I also designed the onboarding process for new engineers.

I regularly have technical training sessions to ensure our engineers are up-to-date with 
the latest technologies and best practices. 1:1s are conducted monthly to ensure 
that the team is aligned with the company's goals, and individuals are supported 
in their career development.

**Project management**

I play a major role in the project management of Univer, including task assignment,
design review, progress tracking, and code review.

### Lark Spreadsheets

At Lark spreadsheets, I was responsible for maintaining features and improving
the maintainability of our codebase. Along with our tech leader and some colleagues, 
I designed a new architecture for Lark spreadsheets and it is partially adopted 
in our codebase, greatly improved the performance and maintainability of the new features.

I also lead a small group of 5 engineers to ensure our front-end is available
and reliable. 

### WeCom (WeChat for Enterprises) Document

During my tenure, I introduced dependency injection into the project, injecting the appropriate implementations for both desktop and mobile platforms. This change significantly reduced the package sizes on each platform. Additionally, I separated the code for non-essential features that are not required for initial screen rendering and implemented lazy loading for these components. This approach delayed their initialization, further decreasing the overall package size. As a result, I successfully reduced the initialization time for an empty document to under one second.

I also optimized the line-breaking algorithm to accurately handle graphemes, ensuring proper rendering of emojis. Furthermore, I enhanced the algorithm for processing lists by transitioning from full processing to incremental processing that aligns with the typesetting progress. This improvement cut the loading time for documents containing lot of list items (over 30,000+) by over ten seconds.

### NG-ZORRO

I actively contributed to the component library community during my internship at Alibaba.
[NG-ZORRO](https://ng.ant.design/) is an enterprise-class UI components based
on Ant Design and Angular. I was responsible for developing and maintaining 20+ components.

## Side Projects

### TWIFY

[**TWIFY**](https://t.wzhu.dev) (short for *That's Why I Follow You*) is a Chrome extension designed to help you take control of your social media experience. It uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze posts and determine whether they align with your interests, ensuring that your feed remains relevant and meaningful. In the extension settings, you can specify why you followed someone, and TWIFY will use an LLM to evaluate their posts, dimming those that may not be of interest to you.

### Reverse Linear's Sync Engine

I [reversed Linear's sync engine](https://github.com/wzhudev/reverse-linear-sync-engine). This study, [according to Linear's co-found and CTO Tuomas Artman](https://github.com/wzhudev/reverse-linear-sync-engine/discussions/2#discussioncomment-12892194),

> is a pretty awesome (and correct) write-up of our sync engine.

### redi

[redi](https://redi.wendell.fun) is a open source dependency injection library. While keeping it
simple, I introduces advanced features such as injecting factories, values, 
and even lazy dependencies based on Promises.

redi powers Univer and several applications including Bitable Dashboard in ByteDance.
